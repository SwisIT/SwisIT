These will provide you with a trouble-free experience and the maximum level of support from the 3CX Support Team, should any issue occur.

The Virtualization platforms that have been tested are Microsoft Hyper-V, VMWare ESXi, KVM and Citrix XenServer. When using these platforms, please ensure to check, and conform to the minimum version requirements.
